### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Jacob, R/functional programming enthusiast by night, data scientist/engineer by day. Here's some of my stuff:

- [updateme](https://github.com/wurli/updateme) - An R package which modifies `library()` to notify you about outdated packages when you load them

- [tidyverse-dev-bot](https://github.com/wurli/tidyverse-dev-bot) - a twitter bot tweeting updates to Tidyverse R packages using GitHub actions

- [ggborderline](https://github.com/wurli/ggborderline) - a ggplot2 extension for making slightly nicer line plots (made for use in my job)

- [pedant](https://github.com/wurli/pedant) - a code-styling tool I made to help my colleagues convert R projects into R packages

- [r-best-practice](https://github.com/wurli/r-best-practice) - a one-page primer document addressing the most common issues I see in code at work

- [pivotr](https://github.com/wurli/pivotr) - an implementation of Excel's pivot tables in R. This was made to help colleagues get familiar with R/Tidyverse pivoting syntax, and to show off my skills with shiny.

- [advent-of-code](https://github.com/wurli/advent-of-code) - for now this is where you can go if you want to see my efforts in other languages (like Rust)
